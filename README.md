OpenSextantToolbox
==================

A GATE based geotagger

Based on the GATE open source text processing framework (http://gate.ac.uk), the OpenSextant Toolbox includes a set 
of GATE processing resources (plugins) which are assembled together to form a document processing pipeline which extracts geospatial information: geographic coordinates and named places. The OpenSextant Toolbox builds upon other elements of the OpenSextant project such as OpenSextant Gazetteer and SolrTextTagger projects.

A  prebuilt version of OpenSextant Toolbox (including data) is available at http://www.opensextant.org/downloads.html
